# K8s good to have

This repo is for me to save how to do some stuff in OCP and k8s.

Most of these stuff you will be able to find in k8s and OCP documentation.

But for me it goes quicker to do a git grep then google.
I do not support any of these commands and if you run in to issue please create an ISSUE but I don't promise that i can give you a solution.
